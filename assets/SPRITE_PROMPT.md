## Post-Generation Checklist

After generating any sprite sheet:

1. **Verify dimensions** — must match the exact pixel size specified
2. **Check transparency** — background must be fully transparent (PNG-32)
3. **Check grid alignment** — `width % columns == 0` and `height % rows == 0`
4. **If dimensions are wrong** — repack using the procedure in `assets/CLAUDE.md`
5. **Test in-game** — load with correct `sliceX`/`sliceY`, verify no frame tearing
6. **Match art style** — compare against `hero_taxpayer.png` for consistent pixel density and proportions

## Iteration Tips

- If the generator produces inconsistent frame sizes, add: `"Each frame must be exactly 116x126 pixels. Use a visible grid overlay to ensure alignment."`
- If poses vary too much between frames, add: `"Consistent character proportions across all frames. Same head size, body width, and foot position in every cell."`
- If the style is too smooth/modern, add: `"Strict pixel art, no anti-aliasing, no gradients, limited color palette (max 16 colors per character)."`
- If characters face different directions, add: `"ALL frames must face RIGHT. The game engine handles horizontal flipping programmatically."`
